  <h1>Why we need Additional Consent</h1>
  
<p>In 2011-2013 you took part in a study to document the speech and accents of Australians; the result of this study is the AusTalk Corpus which will be a valuable resource for speech and language research for many years. </p>
<p>
We are now almost finished collecting this data, comprising audio, video and demographic data, and as part of our review process we realised that the original information that we provided to you and the consent that you signed may not have been explicit about the uses of the data, and the means by which research on Australian speech and language may be conducted. As a result, we have drafted a <a href="/participantportal/termsandconditions/">revised consent form</a> which we hope you will be able to agree to.
</p>
<p>
There are two aspects of this additional consent: </p>
<p>
<b>First,</b> it had always been our goal to make this collection available as widely as possible to anyone interested in research on Australian speech and language. However, the original consent form does not make it clear enough that the data would be available for use by persons other than those involved in the project.
 </p>
 <p>
 So that the data might encourage more research on our Australian English and allow the development of practical applications, such as better telephone speech recognition systems, better aids for learning-impaired children etc., we want also to make the data available to third parties throughout the world.
</p>
<p>
<b>Second,</b> the data that we have collected might allow you to be identified, even if your name was not used; for example,
from your video image and some of the personal information we collected about you.   In the original consent we said
that you would not be identified; we meant that your name would not be associated with your data in any way.  Because 
there is a chance you would be identified from your image, we have taken steps to reduce the detail in the personal 
data that we will make available (eg. your educational history) so that this is less likely.  However, we feel we also need to check that you understand that you might be identified in this way.</p>

<p>
The <a href="/participantportal/termsandconditions/">Additional Consent form</a>  is largely to acknowledge that you understand what your data will be used for and who might use it. If you don't agree to the broader use of the data, we will keep the
video data for use only by the original project organisations in accordance with your original consent.  We feel that
the original consent covers our intended use of the audio data since you cannot be easily identified from that.
