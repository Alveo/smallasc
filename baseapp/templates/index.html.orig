        <p>This site provides access to the Austalk Audio Visual corpus of Australian English.  This 
            corpus was collected from 2011 to 2014 in 15 different locations in all states & territories. 
            The recordings represent the regional and social diversity and linguistic variation of Australian English.
           </p>

        <p>The main purpose of this site is to make the collected data available to researchers who
            will use it to study Australian English in many different ways.   The site also makes it
            possible for participants in the project to review their own recordings.  If you were
            a participant in the project, go to the <a href="/participantportal">Participant Portal</a> where you can 
            login with your Colour + Animal identifier.</p>
            
        <p>If you are a researcher, you can register with the site to be able to review and download parts of 
            the corpus.</p>
